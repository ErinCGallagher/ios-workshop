# iOS Workshop (MVP)

NewsAppDemoMVP is a very basic, stripped down version of [NewsAppDemo](https://github.com/uber-hackher-workshop/ios-workshop/blob/main/README.md). This app doesn't do much, but its a good illustration of how quickly you can get your idea up for an app up and running with live data. If you already know how to use Xcode Storyboards and have your API client code ready to go, this app will take you less than 10 minutes to set up. 

Our advice to you during a Hackathon is: start with this app! UI customization always takes longer than you think. Your first step should be to get something that actually works, and then you can start thinking about design customizations. 

# How to make a copy of this starter project
If your team is looking to make an iOS app, this sample app could be a great starting point. Making a copy of this repo will allow you and your team to make changes that will have **no impact on the original repository**. Go ahead, test things out, break things, that's what a hackathon is all about. 

**Steps:**
1. Create a Github account if you don't have one already.
2. Select the `Fork` button at the top left of the Github window. 

**Expected Result:** A copy of this repository should exist on your github account.

### Adding your team members as Collaborators
Only 1 of your team members will need to fork this repository. Everyone else can be added as collaborators. 
1. Click the `Settings` button on the repository you just forked.
2. Select `Manage Access` from the menu.
3. Click the `Invite a collaborator` button and search for a github username. 

**Expected Result:** A team member can now make changes to your repository.
